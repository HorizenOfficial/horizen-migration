This python script will require the following input parameters
- mainchain block height related to the mainchain dump
- zend dump file path, the zend dump is the one created through the dumper script 
- EON sidechain balance at the height of the first parameter. It can be retrieved using the following api passing its sidechain ID:
  https://explorer.horizen.io/insight-api/scinfo/37a6ec6f308ef03488f7c2affe56215469d936194ff71c2fe3086aedb718a9fa  

It does the following actions:
- calculate the total balance from the height parameter through the calculate_total_supply_from_height and 
  remove_shielded_pool_and_sidechains_balance functions. 
- calculate
- compare this 2 values, if the difference is above a certain threshold print an error

"""
Regarding total balance calculation, Horizen (like every blockchain based on the bitcoin-core node logic) operates on a deflationary token 
economy defined by a halving mechanism that occurs every 840,000 blocks. 
At the outset, miners are rewarded with 1,250,000,000 satoshis (12.5 ZEN) for successfully mining a block. 
However, this reward is systematically reduced by half after every halving event, creating a diminishing supply rate over time. 
For instance, after the first halving, the reward drops to 625,000,000 satoshis (6.25 ZEN), and it continues halving every 840,000 blocks. 

However, during the early days of Horizenâ€™s block history some miners:
- did not claim the full 12.5 ZEN they were eligible to claim
- did not include transactions fees of transactions included in the block
This was due to miners using mining software with settings from Zcash or Zclassic (Zcash had 10 ZEC reward). 
So the value returned by the function needs to be corrected taking into account these rewards not claimed.
It is possible to retrieve from zend the current ZEN total supply combining the current utxo set, the shielded pool balance and the balance 
of all the sidechains and this lead to a difference of 2385.69501304 ZEN.

To compare the calculated balance from the balance from the zend dump we need to subtract:
